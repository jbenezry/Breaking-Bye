# Background and Overview
`Breaking Bye` is a character map for the TV show "Breaking Bad" which will show characters dying off the map, episode by episode, in line with plot developments in the series.

Users will be able to vary the speed of movement through the series as well as the direction (forwards or backwards).  They can also choose to pause the movement altogether and observe the state of all characters (i.e. alive or dead) at any episode in the series.

Characters' last words will appear on screen at the time of their demise.

This project makes use of the [Breaking Bad API](https://breakingbadapi.com/).

# Motivation for project
Breaking Bad is an award-winning, record-breaking TV show that aired on AMC from January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013.  `Breaking Bye` allows fans to relive the culmination of each character's impact on the series.  The last words enhances the user experience by adding a bit of flair when a character's timeline comes to an end.
